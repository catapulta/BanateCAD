Connect HUD to designs


Notes to self
A dynamic design will create a UI configuration.  That configuration
will consist of a number of numeric elements.

Each element has a range, and whether it is discrete or contiguous

desc = {
	title = "Super Ellipse",
	fields = {
		{name = "XRadius", id = "xrad", low="1", high="10", continuous = true},
		{name = "YRadius", id = "yrad", low="1", high="10", continuous = true},
		{name = "N", id = "n", low="0.1", high="5", continuous = false, increment = 0.1},
	}
}
